This Terraform code is used to provision an S3 bucket in AWS using the aws_s3_bucket resource. The code assumes that you have AWS access key and secret key, as well as a region to use. These values are expected to be provided as variables in a variables.tf file.

The S3 bucket is created with a name specified in the var.s3_bucket_name variable, and the access control list (ACL) is set based on the var.acl_bucket variable. The bucket is also tagged with the name "My bucket" and the environment "Dev".

To use this Terraform code, you can follow these steps:

    Create a variables.tf file and define the variables


Create a terraform.tfvars file and provide the values for the variables defined in variables.tf. For example:

~~~

access_key = "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY"
secret_key = "YOUR_SECRET_KEY"
~~~

    Initialize the Terraform configuration by running terraform init in the directory where the main.tf file is located.

    Apply the configuration by running terraform apply. This will create the S3 bucket in your AWS account.

Note: Make sure that you have appropriate AWS permissions to create an S3 bucket and that the access keys provided have the necessary permissions.
